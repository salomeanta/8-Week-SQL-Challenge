## Case Study Questions

### A. Customer Journey

#### 1. Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the `subscriptions` table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
#### Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

The sample table has plan IDs, join the plan table to show plan names.

- Customer with ID 1 started with a trial subscription and continued with a basic monthly subscription in 7 days after sign-up

- Customer with ID 2 started with a trial subscription and continued with a pro annual subscription in 7 days after sign-up

- Customer with ID 11 started with a trial subscription and has churned in 7 days after sign-up

### B. Data Analysis Questions

#### 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

      COUNT(distinct customer_id) AS total_number_of_customers
    FROM
      subscriptions
````

| ------------------------- |
| 1000                      |

#### 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
````sql

count(customer_id) as customer_count
from subscriptions 
where subscriptions.plan_id = 0
group by 1
order by 1
